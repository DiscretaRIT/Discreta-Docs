# Timeline guide
The following document is a general guide on what the timeline of `Discreta` is going to be for every week.

# Merge window
The Merge window is a strict deadline every week before which all code must be merged into your team's repo and the PR from the team's repo should be made to the main repo.

The merge window per week is going to be from `Wednesday` of the current week to `Monday` of the next week.

All contributors and coordinators are requested to make sure that they finish testing and merging code to the main repository by `Monday` of the next week.

The days `Monday`, `Tuesday` and `Wednesday` are taken to fully test how well the new code integrates with the entire codebase and fix any issues that come up during those tests.

This would make sure that the code being finalized by `Wednesday` is completely bug-free and is ready for showcase to the professors.
